GoRails was started as a way to learn web development and the problem solving strategies behind it. We want to provide a fresh approach to learning by showing our learning, problem solving, design, and development processes.

Traditional learning materials give you a structured approach to a solution. We know that problems rarely fit this structure and that any problem can be solved by approaching it the right way.

Chris knows this struggle first hand. As a self-taught engineer, he is familiar with the challenges of becoming a developer.
